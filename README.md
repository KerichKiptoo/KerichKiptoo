## Geospatial Engineering Projects
This repository is a collection of projects that utilize the power of platforms including but not limited to Google Earth Engine and Digital Earth Africa to conduct geospatial analysis and mapping. The projects in the repository focus on a wide range of applications, such as land use and land cover change detection, vegetation monitoring, water resources management, and natural disaster management. It aims to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date resource for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers working in the field of geospatial engineering.

The repository contains a range of projects that utilize the various capabilities of the Google Earth Engine and Digital Earth Africa platforms, such as access to large archives of satellite imagery, cloud-based processing and analysis, and pre-built algorithms for image classification and feature extraction. Each project includes detailed documentation and instructions on how to run and use the code, along with explanations of the methods and techniques used.

The projects in the repository are designed to be flexible and adaptable, allowing users to modify and customize the code to suit their specific research needs. The repository also welcomes contributions from other researchers and practitioners, allowing for a collaborative and open-source approach to geospatial engineering.

Overall, this repository is a valuable resource for anyone interested in using the latest geospatial technologies to conduct research and make informed decisions in the
